# Getting Started

## Software and Installation

To get started modding Sapiens you should install a suitable editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Mod Folder

### Windows (offical platform)
Default installation location is:

 `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Sapiens\GameResources\mods`

### Proton (unoffical)
To install mods for Proton, you have to install them to the Proton prefix, not the game files. The Proton prefix is generally stored at:

```/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/1060230/pfx/drive_c/```

Then you must install mods to: 

`[proton prefix]/users/steamuser/AppData/Roaming/majicjungle/sapiens/mods/`

## Documentation

The current best documentation for getting started modding can be found here: [Sapiens Mod Creation](https://github.com/Majic-Jungle/sapiens-mod-creation).
